# Provider Directory
As a part of my work with CaHPSA, we worked to create two informational brochures for
UC Berkeley students and the City of Berkeley as a whole with helpful info regarding 
health insurance. For both, we identified a need to have a provider database where 
people can search/filter by their insurance company and specific insurance plan to see
a list of providers near them that are in their network. Although such a resource exists
in members' online portals, many may not be aware such a service exists and thus we hope 
that such a database/directory will help them be better able to access the care that they
might need. This is still very much a work in progress as I haven't done a lot of previous
work with APIs, and we are still determining the optimal way of visualizing/displaying this 
database.
