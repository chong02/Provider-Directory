# Provider Directory
As a part of my work with CaHPSA, we worked to create two informational brochures for
UC Berkeley students and the City of Berkeley as a whole with helpful info regarding 
health insurance. For both, we identified a need to have a provider database where 
people can search/filter by their insurance company and specific insurance plan to see
a list of providers near them that are in their network. Although such a resource exists
in members' online portals, many may not be aware such a service exists and thus we hope 
that such a database/directory will help them be better able to access the care that they
might need. This is still very much a work in progress as I haven't done a lot of previous
work with APIs, and we are still determining the optimal way of visualizing/displaying this 
database.

Currently, the project has evolved slightly in its scope/intended use. Per CMS's [May 2020
Interoperability and Patient Access File Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/guidance/document/cms-9115-f-faqs#112)
(CMS-9115-F), insurance companies (often referred to by CMS as payers) are required (better put: asked)
to provide a public-facing provider directory API for Medicare and Medicaid plans. Although many
are still in the works of developing theirs, this project intends to capitalize on this standardized
(at least in theory) API across all insurance companies to provide a one-stop-shop location for
people to find the specialists they might need (particularly for behavioral/mental health visits).

Hopefully in the coming months this project will be more fleshed out and prototype version of some sort
built out sometime soon. :)
